only a month before muybarak application of reform disrupt be futile ''
it be that intolerance reach until the meeting the government

who be the oil exporter be not be to subject their policy of investment to the market rate
they be and
the economist do not include the company which use the attraction of luxury to promote their product

these objective the override goal and objective will be the yardstick by which we judge the proposal put forward by the
the european council will discuss the state of progress of accession negotiation and therefore of enlargement
my party have profound reservation about the regulation of the sale of consumer good by mean of community legislation as it express reservation about the concept of recognition of standard
the point of view illustrate by the matter of the rapporteur and share per number of member consist in promote the regulation and the code of conduct to find between insurer the form of mutualisation of the cost guarantee to all the supply of an quality of care and to counter the risk to see develop practice and a risk selection and customer
I wonder if the commissioner for the step which they show that we consider and as the representative of the people and as the partner with which the european union will have to deal with
all those who be currently engage in work e.g employment in condition
that be why I also believe that this reconciliation can take but the government which have very courageously find a solution to the issue of university and to problem need the sign of success as well as a support on pain of be threaten peace in the region as a whole
we must obviously determine the reason for the increase in the incidence of not only in but also in member state
without doubt it be to have no agreement at all than to have an agreement that be and in this case the proposal be a proposal to you totally for
as the parliament have call for in its resolution of march they initiative council presidency intend to take to play a role in order to ensure the implementation of the peace plan
the maintenance of the service to the assistance of a compensation fund which engage the advantage of service will probably long fire

the labelling of beef which have be decide which be a and labelling which be in force for and a month do not properly to trace the origin of the animal and we have ban quite specify risk material

the creation of a unit of cooperation be a step in the direction which the european parliament have be strive for a time
the debate be closed
those who reject the cooperation have the freedom of movement that passenger in the seat of a car
in my opinion there be nothing than have to inform the people to be make in their favour could be that a series of word and have no worry on their existence
by withdraw our resolution I be however convince that would do to devote its voice in view of the nice a resolution and the extremely subject and if the intergovernmental conference rather than treat they within the framework of a resolution include also all item on the agenda of the

it be not on this point and it be not that can also remain in force measure especially on this point than we table amendment
ship be sink without any storm around mr gayssot
unfortunately the objective of a constitution would be and obviously we can not support it
I make an appeal to the presidency to do everything in its power to fill this role
a policy which have be strongly capital
this be a development of this type that I wish to of the european union
it be in say that the committee on legal affair continue in the refusal of a ceiling and the maintenance of a minimum rate which can not be than
thing deteriorate when it be a question of woman from country which have accept this work and who have no possibility to continue to provide their need

the labelling of beef which be decide which be a labelling and which come into effect only since month and do not make it to suitably recall the origin of the animal and we prohibit well tardily the specify risk material
since the european parliament have decide in favour of a prohibition of the use of the bone meal in the european union in accordance with the principle so only it have be listen to
you do not even want to incorporate into the which show that this text should be set aside
face with criticism especially those in and the chancellor of the give a interpretation of it it be now a tax for all user include the driver of good vehicle
and I say to you very clearly we must give its chance and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty during the week and month ahead but in the meantime I hope however that politically and in term of the budget the condition be link to the introduction of these line namely democratisation and reconstruction
it be a development of this type which I hope in the state of the european union
you do not even want to incorporate into the that prove that this text should be set aside
above all unipersonnelle when a company or a society with than employee have a project it must be to receive financing not only with a guarantee to but also on the basis of a idea
I find it a strange to try now to force the commission to a motion for a resolution and ask he at the time to draw up a paper on the state of insurance and sickness insurance
I stress this point because the market can not solve all and in this sense there can not be any competition without limit
undoubtedly be it not to have an agreement than to have an agreement which be and in this case the proposal be a proposal with the reduction completely for
we must welcome the fact that have manage to gather a majority in favour of transparency
on the the power of the democracy decrease in force of limit increasingly the right of veto and to give ever power in of the

above all when a business or a society with than a project it must be for a mean not only with a guarantee to but also on the basis of a idea
the creation of a unit of cooperation constitute a step in the direction not to which the european parliament aspire for a time already
I already answer on this point and I subscribe completely so that he say on the need for improve the debate considerably I will not return on what I say but it be that too often the citizen feel with decision which be make in authority that they do not know
these objective the objective and objective will represent the stone of enable we to consider the concrete proposal present by the
when we be face with a risk it be to implement the principle
since the on this issue which take place at the level on the initiative of the parliament the be in relation to the member state to promote an action intend to what we could consider as a culture on the they in the matter of respect for the right and freedom of the citizen and effectiveness in the fight against crime
mr president lady and gentleman I would like to speak on the resolution that of course we will
these objective the objective of and objective the cornerstone of allow we to judge the proposal by the
on the situation in
by withdraw our resolution I express however the conviction that our would have do to hear its voice while devote for conseil of nice a resolution specific and with the so and so topic to the conference rather than to treat they within the framework of resolution also include all the point of about an agenda of the
those who refuse and enjoy the freedom of movement as the passenger out of a car
I know that in the principle of the whole and that it do not seem to be the way to combat this phenomenon
there be urgency and that be why we have decide to put this item on the agenda
that be what we have do we have avoid a crisis by return to article the perspective have be maintain even if we have use the flexibility instrument
the establishment of a unit of cooperation be a step in the direction not to which the european parliament want a time ago
I appeal urgently to the presidency to do everything in its power to bridge this gap particularly
these week progress be make
it be not the moment to be
we can indeed want and but quite honestly that I believe this be a start
I would also have like to see the report of the court of auditor a little and if he have present a recommendation for example or recommendation by chapter
we must say no to the concept be recognise that the bang but at the time a group of country because this would be in contradiction with the principle of the admission of each country on its merit
the way for which no tax be not yet see be that of supply in the european community from country
I have already reply to this point and I agree entirely with what he say about the need to improve considerably the debate I will not repeat what I say but it be that all too often citizen feel alienated to decision that be take in body that they do not know
give these reality the need for involvement and efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment be
my party have reservation about the regulation of the sale of consumer good through community legislation as it express reservation about the concept of recognition of standard
face with this situation the need for involvement and effectiveness in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment be
that be why I also believe that this reconciliation can take however the government which have very courageously find a solution to the issue of university and problem need sign of success and a support otherwise the peace threaten in the region as a whole
the case for which no tax be a delivery be still see in the european community from a country
the task which be however capital do not arouse an interest on behalf of the yet
it be on trial on january be accuse he for having take part in a meeting of opponent in which also it deny
when we be face with a risk it be to put into practice the principle of precaution
b5 0794 by mr medina ortega on behalf of the group of the party of socialist and the group of the party of socialist from a in the negotiation with the
we have hear that the presidency restructure then dismantle the ministry for opportunity
in my view however there be nothing than to have to inform people that a ruling in their favour can only be a series of reassure word and have no effect on their existence
es mr president enlargement be for the construction of a and united european continent
either we be part of the club or we be not and we must therefore we bow to that decision
this be a disgrace when you think that the european union raise a champion of the modernisation of life
it be what we do we avoid a crisis while return in article the perspective be maintain even if we use the flexibility instrument
the declaration must be follow action to identify freeze seize and confiscate the product of the crime
mr president lady and gentleman I would like to speak on the resolution that obviously we shall vote
I urge the presidency to should do everything in its power to bridge the gap particularly
the task which be however have not yet a interest on the part of the public
I invite to seize this sign this invitation this request for dialogue to follow up and to ensure that together with this these relique an era nationalist may be abandon
finally and this be something which be the committee have call vehemently to use the procedure to implement this legislation
there be of course a very point be the fact that we start in category with its approach but we do not yet know very well if we manage to resolve the issue not because the do not wish to participate sufficiently in the reflection
this be why I also think that this reconciliation can hold however the government which very courageously find a solution with the question of the university and problem need sign of the success as well as support under penalty of see the peace threaten as a whole of the area
it be the position defend by the rapporteur and share by the people 's party

the situation be worsen when it come to woman country which have accept this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to meet their need
that be not the time to take hesitant
the european council will also discuss the progress of the accession negotiation and therefore of enlargement
if we want to help we must intervene now with money and action and not only with word
just as the court of right the council of europe also have a experience in this regard form of control and we can take as a basis

this have however also fight for this reduction of fund for action should be compensate for by the use of flexibility define in a statement on the perspective
we should obviously determine the reason of the incidence of the not only in but also in member state
it must be respect and protect
finally and this be a topic the have call with vigour to make use of the procedure to implement this legislation
the debate must be follow by action to identify freeze seize and confiscate the proceed of crime

I thank the rapporteur for the committee on affair mr brok for his and report
above all when a business or a society with than employee have a project it must be to receive financing not only to guarantee to but merely on the basis of a idea
I have already reply on this point and I entirely agree with what he have say about the need to improve considerably the debate and I will not repeat what I say but it be that all too often citizen feel alienated to decision that be take in the body that they do not know
es mr president enlargement be for the construction of a and continent of
this be why I also think that this reconciliation can hold however the government which have very courageously find a solution to the question and to problem need sign of success so that a support to the peace in the whole of the region
I thank the rapporteur of the committee on foreign affair mr brok on his and report
nevertheless I would wish to say to the this afternoon that we should not lose sight of the fact the fact that the european union spend only of the gdp of the member state and that the part of this money be manage in the member state
you do not even want to incorporate into the which prove that this text should be put to side
I launch an appeal with the presidency so that it do all that be in its capacity to fill this particularly ditch
we have hear that the and then the inequality of opportunity
on the the influence of the democracy decrease by limit always the right of veto and to give always capacity to the parliament of the eu
finally and this be a subject the commission to make use of the procedure for the implementation of this legislation
of all the simplification and clarification of the treaty
this be of a development that I hope the member state of the european union
mr president I vote for the garcía margallo y report which concern the taxation of service provide by mean
that of a simplification of the treaty
thank you very much commissioner
that be why I also believe that this reconciliation can have however the government which have very courageously a solution to the issue of university and problem need sign of success as well as support otherwise the peace in the region as a whole
the thing be not on this point and it be not that can also remain in force provision it be in on this point that we introduce amendment
I think it be that be resolve to take that step
have develop a remarkably the neighbourhood which have always exist between and north africa and between and
it happen in trial on january he be accuse of having attend a meeting of opponent in which he deny
I would also have like to see the report of the court of auditor fusse a little and it would have put forward some recommendation for example or recommendation by chapter
these objective the objective and objective will be the yardstick for judge the proposal put forward by the
the right for a government to remove arbitrarily its constitution be define characteristic of a tyranny
these objective the objective and objective will represent the touchstone of enable we to consider the specific proposal present by the
it be just that the on affair of the refusal of a ceiling and in the maintenance of a minimum rate which can not be
we have start to have exchange on this issue where it emerge that all the member state want the maintenance of this ceiling after enlargement
vessel flow without any storm in around mr gayssot
b5 0794 by mr medina ortega mr linkohr and mr fava on behalf of the group of the party of socialist on removal of a jesuit engage in negotiation with the guerrilla
let we to organise ourselves to welcome in condition to the country knock at our door
we speak with a voice within the
for this cooperation for your support and also for your reception madam president lady and gentleman the presidency would like to thank you
this be our priority struggle for the affirmation of right have find expression in choice
I would have also wish that the report of the court of auditor be a little and that it have present some recommendation for example or recommendation per chapter
in my view however there be nothing than have to warn people that a ruling in their favour could not have be a series of word réconfortant and do not have any consequence concrete on their existence
I find a to want as of now force the commission with a motion for resolution and to ask he in the time to establish green paper on the state of the insurance and the health insurance
they will continue to put pressure the money that they earn with the distribution beyond the limit of gram allow they to strengthen their position
I wonder whether the commissioner already provide step which will show that we regard as the legally elect representative of the people and as the partner with which the european union must now address
a budget line financing demining and prevention programme for
as request by the european parliament in its resolution of march that these initiative the presidency of the european council be go to take to play a role in order to ensure the implementation of the peace plan
I have already reply on this point and I entirely agree with what he have say on the need to improve considerably the debate I will not go back to what I say but it be that all too often the citizen feel foreigner to decision that be take in the body that they do not know
the activity of link between the people
the point of view illustrate by the word of the rapporteur and share by colleague be to promote the regulation and the code of conduct need to establish between insurer form of cost guarantee to all the provision of a quality of care and to counter the risk of see develop practice and a selection of risk and customer
if employment be the priority of the the fishing industry as the sector can not remain on the sideline
thus it be that the group staff should be strengthen very quickly at the heart of the general secretariat of the commission so that all proposal to act of scope can be accompany during their examination by the college on the basis of article a impact statement
the activity create link between people
this but also fight so that this reduction in fund allocate to the action be offset by the use of framework of flexibility as define in a statement on the perspective
the safeguarding of the service to the aid of a compensation fund which would make it to engage in profit for the benefit of the service will probably long
above all when a company unipersonnelle or a company with than employee be a project it must be to receive financing not only with a guarantee to but also on the basis of a idea
I would also have like the report of the court of auditor fusse somewhat and he seen table a recommendation for example or recommendation by chapter
finally in a word the pillar of the approach of the approach adopt by the gender mainstreaming and guideline
lastly in a word the pillar dedicate to the opportunity consolidate the approach of the equality by the gender mainstreaming and guide line
in the people all ijaw accuse to incite violence against they and to pay soldier to draw on the demonstrator in the warri base
furthermore we would have a chance to demonstrate to that we be to develop only equality of and within recognise the principle
the task which be have not yet be a interest on the part of the public
be not condemn to remain in the group and it be that it want to join the union at the time as the czech republic
all those who be currently work to obtain an employment in condition
but I would like to say to the this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the european union spend only of the gdp of the member state and that the bulk of this money be administer in the member state
have develop in a way the extremely neighbourhood that have always exist between and north africa and between and
mr president I vote in favour of the report y which concern the taxation of service provide by mean
thus it be that the staff of the interservice group be very quickly strengthen at the heart of the secretariat of the committee so that all the propose act of scope can be accompany by the college in their discussion on the basis of article paragraph a fiche d'impact detailed
these objective the overarching and objective represent the touchstone allow we to judge the proposal present by the
in fact it be by no mean that the definition of fair price which be be propose be than another because the definition currently use in the member state all be
mr president enlargement be for the construction of a and continent
labour member of the group of the party of socialist welcome the contribution to the work of the on cooperation without fully adhere to all the detail of it
that be why I believe that this reconciliation can take however the government which have very courageously find a solution to the issue of university and problem need sign of success and a support otherwise the peace throughout the region
without doubt worth it not to have an agreement that will have an agreement that be and in this case the proposal be a proposal for
we speak with voice disgracieuse within the
we start to have exchange on this question from where it arise that all the member state wish the maintenance of this ceiling after widen
if we create a framework and binding on the member state the system to meet these requirement should have a period of put to the test
finally I welcome the idea of give we an meeting in order to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme
in the all ijaw accuse to encourage violence against they and to go as far as to pay soldier to draw on the demonstrator in the base of
the report aim to identify improvement
we welcome the measure propose in this respect by the committee and decide by the general assembly with regard to the system of accreditation of organisation with the process and the session in september
it be an matter and it be to this that we have to put this point to the order of the day
those which refuse the cooperation enjoy the freedom of movement as the passenger of the seat of a car
statement must be match by action to identify freeze seize and confiscate the proceed of crime
the european council will also discuss the progress of the negotiation of adhesion and thus widen
we must be since we be still in uncertainty what be the datum what be the measure to be take
the case for which no tax be still perceive be that of a delivery in the european community start from a country
as the parliament ask it in its resolution of march that they initiative the presidency of the council do hope to take to play a part in order to guarantee the application and peace plan of
thing be not on this point and it be not that can also remain in force provision this be particularly on this point that we have table amendment
if we define a framework and constrain for the member state the system have to satisfy these requirement should have a period of set with the test
as the court of human right the council of europe have also experience as regard form of control we can take as a basis
madam president I would ask you on behalf of my colleague in the committee on fishery and on my behalf to send a message of condolence from to the family of the victim and the authority of both and marã­n city of which of the victim
in feira he have recognise the quality of candidate for accession to the country participate in the stabilisation and association process
have develop in a remarkably the neighbourhood which always exist between and north africa and between and
the incident against the minority in make it the need to promote measure for democratisation strengthen the institution and respect for right in
thus it be that the staff of the interservice group be very quickly strengthen at the heart of the secretariat of the committee so that all the propose act of scope can be accompany during their examination by the college on the basis of article a fiche d'impact detail
we need to know since we be still in uncertainty what be the datum what be the measure to be take
the task which be capital have not yet be a lively interest on the part of the public
by mr medina ortega and on behalf of the group of the party of socialist on the kidnapping in of a jesuit engage in negotiation with the guerilla
I would urge to seize this sign this invitation this request for dialogue to follow they up and to ensure that together with this these relic of a era can be abandon
it be to know since we be always in uncertainty which be the datum which be the measure to be take
mr president we have to know the 's position in relation to access to document on read the manuel which have be submit on october to the official in order to explain how they deal with the request of member regard access to document

I would like to thank the rapporteur of the committee on foreign affair mr brok for his and report
if the employment be the policy of the union the community as a sector can not remain on the sideline
thing be not on this point and it be not that we can also remain in force provision but particularly on this point that we have table amendment
the lesson for we within this in its debate this morning be that we be force to conclude that the maritime law be in the world in a state of control and that we must get down to the task to put its house in order
we welcome the propose provision in this respect by the committee and decide by the general assembly as regard the method of accreditation organisation the process and the session of september
in feira he recognize the quality of candidate to adhesion with the country take part in the stabilisation process and of association
it be a disgrace when we think that the european union raise champion of the modernisation of life
I would also have like to see the report of the court of auditor be a and that he have table a number of recommendation for example or recommendation by chapter
in it he have recognise the quality of candidate for membership in the country participate in the stabilisation and association process
by withdraw our resolution I be nevertheless convinced that our would have do to its voice hear by spending for the of nice a resolution specific and with so and so issue to the intergovernmental conference rather than to deal with they in the context of a resolution include also all the item on the agenda of the
the activity create link between the people
there be of course a very point be the fact that we have start category with his approach but we do not yet know very well if we manage to solve the problem particularly because the do not wish to participate in the discussion
it be gratify that have manage to gather a majority in favour of transparency
for this cooperation for your support and also for your welcome madam president lady and gentleman of the institution the presidency thank you
if we create a and bind framework for the member state the system have to meet these requirement should have a period of put to the test
the resolution on the nice summit which have just be adopt do not reflect it
thing be get when it be a matter of woman from country which have accept this work by necessity and which have no alternative to continue to provide for their need
I know that in the principle of slaughter of the herd have be apply and that this do not seem to be the way to combat this phenomenon
unfortunately the objective of a constitution would be exactly the opposite and obviously we can not endorse it
finally I welcome the idea of give we an meeting in order to take stock of the implementation of the programme
nevertheless I would like to say to the this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the european union spend only of the gdp of the member state and that of this money be manage in the member state
accept the amendment
that be what we have do we avoid a crisis back to article the perspective have be maintain even if we use the flexibility instrument
have develop a remarkably the neighbourhood which have always exist between and north africa and between and
since the reflection on this issue which take place at level at the initiative of the parliament the be towards the member state to promote action to develop what we could consider it as a police culture focus on the standard in the field of ethic respect for the right and freedom of the people and effectiveness in the fight against crime
we welcome the propose provision in this respect by the committee and decide by the meeting with regard to the method of accreditation of organisation the process and to the session in september
criticism particularly those of and the chancellor of the give a interpretation of it it would be now about a tax for all the user include the driver of lorry
mr president the committee on citizen freedom and right justice and internal affair have prepare very carefully the report
the incident against the minority in make the need to promote measure to democratisation the strengthening of institution and the respect for right in
the resolution on the nice summit which have just be adopt do not reflect
the activity create link between people
the case for which no tax be not yet see be of supply in the european community from a country
however I would like to say to the this afternoon that we must not lose sight of the fact that the european union be spend that of gdp in the member state and that of this money be manage in the member state
the right for a government to dismiss its arbitrarily be the define characteristic of a tyranny
this could also apply to all drug but insofar as the consumer of drug be the to run risk
it be obviously to clarify the reason for the increase in the incidence of not only in but also in member state
we can indeed wish and but I think quite honestly that it be a start
the statement must be follow by action to identify freeze seize and confiscate the proceed of crime
I know that in the slaughter of herd principle be apply and that it do not seem to be the way to combat this phenomenon
the sitting be suspend at be resume at p.m
they will continue to put pressure on the money they earn with distribution beyond the bound of gram enable they to improve their position
I also vote against a text which require the integration of the charter of fundamental right in the future which will be adopt in

from the european parliament have declare itself in favour of a ban on the use of meat and bone meal in the european union in accordance with the principle only if we have listen
I find it a to now force the commission to a motion for a resolution and ask he at the time to draw up a paper on the state of and insurance sickness insurance
do you believe that the model – namely majority will in an instrument to take decision by ignore the institution and start a institution or a group to get round the unanimity rule in the
it be accept that the knowledge of language be a reference to the mobility
it be not the time to be
just as the court of human right the council of europe also have a experience in term of form of control we can to base
it be not on this point and it be not that can also remain in force for provision this be particularly on this point that we have table amendment
it be that the committee on legal affair persist in refuse a ceiling and a minimum rate which can not be below
as the court of human right the council of europe also have a experience with regard to form of control we can take it as a basis
mr president we can not know the position of the in the matter of access to document in read the ha that have be postpone on october the official of the in order to explain the way in which they have to deal with the request in this regard access to document
if we define a framework and binding on the member state the system to meet these requirement should have a period of be test
a development which make capital borrow heavily
that be why I also believe that this reconciliation can take and the government which have very courageously find a solution to the issue of university and problem need sign of success and a support otherwise the peace threaten in the region as a whole
this be what we have do we have a budget crisis in come to article the perspective have be maintain even if we have use the flexibility instrument
face with these reality the need for involvement and of efficiency in the fight against poverty and underdevelopment be
I know that in the principle of slaughter of the herd have be implement and that this do not seem to be the way to combat this phenomenon
finally I welcome the idea of give we an meeting in order to make an assessment of the implementation of the programme
unfortunately the objective of a constitution would be exactly and obviously we can not approve it
the creation of a cooperation be a step in the direction which the european parliament for a time
the thing worsen when it be question of woman of country who accept this work by need and who do not have any possibility to continue to provide for their need
if we define a and bind for the member state the system to meet these requirement should have a period of put to the test
the statement must be match by action to identify freeze seize and confiscate the proceed of crime
the task which be capital have not yet arouse interest on the part of the public
either we be part of the club or we be not and we must therefore abide by this decision
let we hold to in order to be to welcome in the right condition which country knock at our door
a development which have make the heavily dependent on capital borrow
I appeal urgently to the presidency to do everything in its power to fill that gap particularly
we have hear that the presidency be restructure then dismantle the ministry of opportunity
face with these the necessity of a involvement and effectiveness in the fight against poverty and be
in the people all ijaw have accuse of encourage the violence against they and to go up to pay soldier to draw on the demonstrator at the base of
I appeal urgently to the presidency to do everything in its power to fulfil this particularly gap
the incident against the minority in make that measure to promote democratisation strengthen the institution and respect for right in
the labelling of beef which have be decide which be a labelling and which have only be in force for and a month do not make it to properly remind the origin of the animal and we ban very late specify risk material
thing when it come to woman 's distant country which accept this work by need and which have no option to continue to provide for their need
furthermore we would like to have a chance to prove to the that we be to develop only the equality of and in recognise the principle
they will continue to put pressure the money they earn with the distribution beyond the limit of gramme enable they to strengthen their position
I wonder whether the police chief envisage already stage which will make it to show that we regard as the legally elect representative of people and as the partner with whom the european union will have henceforth to treat
it be and it be for that reason that we have decide to put this item on the agenda
the resolution on the nice summit which have just be vote do not reflect it
madam president I would ask you on behalf of my colleague in the committee on fishery and on my behalf to send a message of condolence from to the family of the victim and the authority of both brittany marín that the city of which be from of the victim
in my view there be however nothing than have to warn people that a ruling for they could only be a series of word please and have no effect on their existence
the point of view illustrate by the subject of the rapporteur and share by colleague be to promote the regulation and code of conduct to be find between insurer the form of cost guarantee to all the supply of quality care and to counter the risk to see develop practice and a selection of risk and customer
criticism especially those of and the chancellor of the have give a interpretation it be now a tax for all user include the lorry driver
we can indeed wish and but I quite honestly believe that it be a start
b5 by mr medina ortega mr linkohr and mr fava on behalf of the group of the party of socialist on the kidnapping of a jesuit engage in negotiation with the guerrilla
the report be to identify improvement
you do not want to even integrate it in the which prove that this text be to be put on side
this be our priority for the affirmation of right to be implement in choice
let we here in order to be to welcome in condition the country that be knock at our door
either we be part of the club we be not and we must therefore we have to comply with this
I wonder whether the commissioner already provide for step to show that we regard as the legally elect representative of the people and as a partner with which the european union must now address
we have start to have exchange on this issue it emerge that all the member state wish to the maintenance of this ceiling after enlargement
they continue to put the pressure that they earn money with the distribution of the limit of gramme allow they to strengthen their position
since the thought on this issue which be hold at level on the initiative of the parliament the be commit to member state to promote an action intend to develop what we could consider a police culture focus on the standard in term of ethic right and freedom and efficiency in the fight against crime
since the reflexion on this file which take place at the level on the initiative of the parliament the commit itself with respect to the member state promote an action intend to develop what we could regard as a police culture center on the standard as regard deontology of respect for the right and freedom of the citizen and of effectiveness in the fight against crime
all those who be currently work on the would get job under condition
mr president I vote in favour of the garcia margallo y report which concern the taxation of service provide electronically
mr president we know the position of the on access to document in the manual which be submit on october the 's official in order to explain how to handle application by member as regard access to document
this rule can apply besides to all récréationnelle but drug in so far as the consumer of drug be the only one to run risk
I find that will be to take this step
it be to say not to the concept big bang which would like that admit at the time an group of country because that would be in conflict with the principle of the admission of each country accord to its merit
lastly and it be there a subject the commission invite with strength to make use of the procedure accelerate to put in uvre this legislation
the safeguarding of the service with compensation fund which would make it to initiate profit for the benefit of the service will probably failure
this have however also for this fund action by the use of framework define in a statement on the perspective
above all when a company unipersonnelle or a society with than employee have a project it must be to benefit from fund not only with a guaranteed to but also on the basis of a idea
the accept the amendment
in addition we would like to be to prove in which we be to develop only the equality of and within by recognize the principle
and I would say to you very clearly it must be give a chance to and I therefore hope that it will provide an amnesty over the week or month but in the meantime I hope however that in term and in term the condition be link to the introduction of these budget line namely democratisation and reconstruction
a budget line have programme to de mining and prevention for
we congratulate the provision propose in this respect by the and by the assembly of the united nation with regard to the method of organisation and the session of september
I find that have resolve to take that step
by withdraw our resolution I be nonetheless convinced that our would have do in devote its voice to the nice european a resolution and issue so and so to the intergovernmental conference rather than to deal with they in the context of a resolution include also all the item on the agenda of the
in the european parliament be in favour of a ban on the use of meat meal in the european union in accordance with the principle if only we have listen to
we shall talk with voice disgracieuse within the
the labelling of beef which have be decide which be a labelling and which have only be in force for and a month ago do not make it to trace the origin of animal properly very late and have ban the specify risk material
without doubt just to have no agreement than have an agreement that be and in this case the proposal be a proposal which be totally for
it be allow that the knowledge of language be a precondition with mobility

I stress this point because the market can not regulate everything and that in this context it be not or can not be without border
we can in fact want and but I believe that it be a start
it be rightly that the committee on legal affair and citizen right persist in the rejection of a ceiling and in the maintenance of a minimum rate which can not be below
we have start to have discussion on this issue which show that all the member state want to keep the ceiling after enlargement
we have start to have trade on this issue where it appear that all member state wish to maintain this ceiling after enlargement

we have hear that the presidency have restructure and then dismantle the ministry of opportunity

I insist on this point because the market can not regulate everything and that in this perspective there be neither can be no competition without limit
they will continue to put the pressure the money that they gain with the distribution beyond the limit of the gram make it they to reinforce their position
I also vote against a text which call for the integration of the charter of fundamental right in the future which will be adopt at

either we belong to the club or let we not be we and we thus should be fold with this decision
I stress this because the market can not solve all and that accordingly there be not and can not have competition without limit
as the european parliament have call for in its resolution of march that they initiative will the presidency of the european council intend to take to play a role in order to ensure the implementation of the peace plan
nevertheless I would like to say to the idea that we must not lose sight of the fact that the european union do not believe that of the gdp of the member state and that the bulk of this money be manage in the member state
in week progress have be make
it be a disgrace when it be believe that the european union have set itself up as a champion modernisation of life

on the the power of the democracy be increasingly to restrict the right of veto and of give power for the
my party issue reservation in connection with the regulation of the sale of product of consumption by the mean of the community legislation just like it issue reserve in connection with the concept of recognition of the standard
I find that exemplary commit itself to take this step
it be of course a very point it be the fact that we have the section with its approach but we do not yet know very well if we manage to solve the problem in because the do not wish to participate enough
and let I make it very it be to give its chance and I therefore hope that it will ensure an amnesty in the week and month ahead but in the meantime I wish however that politically and the level the condition be couple with the introduction of these line namely democratisation and reconstruction
